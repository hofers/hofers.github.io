              <p><a href="https://movies.seanhofer.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">I aM a DB</a> is a
                project I did as a technical test for the <a href="https://www.teachtci.com/" target="_blank"
                  rel="noreferrer">Teacher's
                  Curriculum Institute</a>. I aM a DB is an app that lets users browse for
                and post movie reviews. It's my first project built using Ruby on Rails, and my first real introduction
                unit testing (in Minitest). The front-end is built using React and Bootstrap and I'm using <a

                service that spawned from <a href="#fed40-web">Fed 40</a>. It consists of a mobile app
                built in Flutter as well as a web application which is pure HTML/CSS & jQuery. All hosting, routing and
                back-end functionality are handled by various services in AWS (S3, CloudFront, Route 53, EC2, RDS,
                Lambda, API Gateway, etc.). All API functionality is written in Node.js.

                It is made in Flutter, Google's new Dart-based mobile app SDK. I rewrote the app from its original
                incarnation in React Native back when the program was Fed 40. The back-end is shared across web and
                mobile.

              <h3>Feeding Children Everywhere | August 2018</h3>
              <p>An August 2018 change in our policy regarding product tracking resulted in a need to individually
                label each meal bag packaged at a hunger project with a sticker denoting the associated project. I was
                tasked with creating a simple PDF generation interface the operations team could use to create and
                print the sticker sheets themselves. I accomplished this using <a href="http://pdfkit.org/">PDFKit</a>,
                JavaScript and very minimal HTML.

              <p>One of my earliest large projects at FCE was building the landing page for our newly rebranded meal.
                It's a simple static landing page, hosted on S3 and made with plain old HTML/CSS, with a bit of JS to
                handle the contact form as well as an animation library.

              <h3>Feeding Children Everywhere | January 2017</h3>
              <p>Fed 40 is what Full Cart was called for the first ~2 years of its existence before being
                relaunched in September 2018. The website originated as a short and simple form one could fill out to
                request a box of our meals, with very plain design and bare development. I maintained it and managed it
                through two complete visual overhauls, during which I implemented new features and improved user
                experience. (<i>Note: This site is deprecated, so there are
                  no longer any live instances of it.</i>)

              <h3>Feeding Children Everywhere | January 2017</h3>
              <p>The original Fed 40 mobile app was programmed in React Native, which I maintained until July 2018 when
                I rewrote the app from scratch in Flutter. It was originally just a form, with no navigation and little
                exposition. I expanded the app to include more functionality, like donations and links to blog posts,
                and also handled the implementation of new designs in two complete visual overhauls of the
                service. (<i>Note: This app is deprecated, so there are no longer any live links to it.</i>)

              <p>My project I worked on as a group at HackRiddle 2016. I developed the Chrome extension that comprised
                the end-user interface. It could be used to send a screenshot and link as well as additional
                information about an instance of online abuse to a specified administrator with access to the backend
                dashboard. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Won 1st place in the Anti-Bullying category</span>. (<i>Note:
