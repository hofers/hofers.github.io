:wave: Hi! I'm Sean Hofer, an Associate Software Engineer on the E-commerce team at [Minted](https://www.minted.com){% out %}, an online marketplace of independent artists and designers in San Francisco, CA. 

&emsp;I started at Minted in October 2019 as an Email Developer building marketing emails and working to implement product recommendations into our triggered and transactional emails, and eventually I began helping the marketing team with a number of A/B test implementations and UI updates & fixes as a flexible engineering resource. In July 2020, I joined the e-commerce team as an Associate Software Engineer, where I've been building out my full-stack experience with tasks that range from adding and modifying API endpoints to UI updates to building internal tools for modifying database entries. 

&emsp;In my previous position at Feeding Children Everywhere (now [US Hunger](https://www.ushunger.org){% out %}), I helped to build and launch [Full Cart](https://www.fullcart.org){% out %}, a meal kit delivery application that's grown to serve over 1000 households weekly. I'm quick to adapt to new languages and libraries, and I have a knack for coming up with creative solutions to technical problems. I'm also proficient with web technologies like HTML5/CSS3, JS/jQuery, React, Python, Jekyll and Ruby, as well as mobile development platforms like React Native and Flutter and query languages like SQL.

&emsp;If you're interested in contacting me, drop me a line via my [contact](/contact) page, or reach out to me directly at {% my_email %} or on my [LinkedIn](/linkedin){% out %}. You can also check out my [resume](/resume) and my [portfolio](/portfolio) to learn more about some of my previous work. My current work is mostly full-stack web development, but I'm always excited to pick up new skills. 

&emsp;And thanks for checking out my site!
