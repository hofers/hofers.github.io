:wave: Hi! I'm Sean Hofer, an Email Developer / Growth Engineer at <a href="https://www.minted.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Minted</a>, an online marketplace of independent artists and designers in San Francisco, CA.

&emsp;In my time at Minted so far I've led implementation of product recommendations into our triggered and transactional emails, and I've helped the marketing team with a number of A/B test implementations and UI updates and fixes as a flexible engineering resource. In my previous position at <a href="https://www.feedingchildreneverywhere.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Feeding Children Everywhere</a>, I helped to build and launch Full Cart, a meal kit delivery application that has now grown to serve over 1000 households weekly.

&emsp;I'm quick to adapt to new languages and libraries, and I have a knack for coming up with creative solutions to technical problems. I'm also proficient with web technologies like HTML5/CSS3, React, jQuery, Python and Node.js, as well as mobile development platforms like React Native and Flutter.

&emsp;If you're interested in contacting me, drop me a line at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">{{ site.email }}</a> or hit me up on my <a href="/linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> page. You can also check out my <a href="/resume">resume</a> and my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>. My current work is mostly front and back-end web development, but I'm always excited to pick up new skills.
