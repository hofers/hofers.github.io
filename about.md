:wave: Hi! I'm Sean Hofer, a Senior Software Engineer on the Customizer team at [Minted](https://www.minted.com){% out %}, an online marketplace of independent artists and designers in San Francisco, CA. 

&emsp;I started at Minted in October 2019 as an Email Developer building marketing emails and working to implement product recommendations into our triggered and transactional emails, and eventually I began helping the marketing team as a flexible engineering resource. Nowadays, I'm a Senior Software Engineer on the Customizer front-end team, which focuses on development of Minted's [Customizer](https://customizer.minted.com/MIN-XO8-IFS){% out %} application.

&emsp;In my previous position at Feeding Children Everywhere (now [US Hunger](https://www.ushunger.org){% out %}), I helped to build and launch [Full Cart](https://www.fullcart.org){% out %}, a meal kit delivery program for food-insecure families that's grown to serve over 1000 households weekly. I'm quick to adapt to new languages and libraries, and I have a knack for coming up with creative solutions to technical problems. I'm also proficient with web technologies like TypeScript, React, HTML5/CSS3, JSX/JS/jQuery, Python, Jekyll and Ruby, as well as mobile development platforms like React Native and Flutter and query languages like GraphQL, SQL and Cypher (for Neo4J).

&emsp;If you're interested in contacting me, drop me a line via my [contact](/contact) page, or reach out to me directly at {% my_email %} or on my [LinkedIn](/linkedin){% out %}. You can also check out my [resume](/resume) and my [portfolio](/portfolio) to learn more about some of my previous work. My current work is mostly full-stack web development, but I'm always excited to pick up new skills. 

&emsp;And thanks for checking out my site!
