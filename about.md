:wave: Hi! I'm Sean Hofer, an Associate Software Engineer on the E-commerce team at [Minted](https://www.minted.com){% out %}, an online marketplace of independent artists and designers in San Francisco, CA. 

&emsp;In my time at Minted so far I've led implementation of product recommendations into our triggered and transactional emails and helped the marketing team with a number of A/B test implementations and UI updates & fixes as a flexible engineering resource. And in July 2020, I joined the E-commerce team as an Associate Software Engineer, where I'll have the opportunity to make more significant code contributions in a production environment. 

&emsp;In my previous position at [Feeding Children Everywhere](https://www.feedingchildreneverywhere.com){% out %}, I helped to build and launch Full Cart, a meal kit delivery application that's grown to serve over 1000 households weekly. I'm quick to adapt to new languages and libraries, and I have a knack for coming up with creative solutions to technical problems. I'm also proficient with web technologies like HTML5/CSS3, React, jQuery, Python, Jekyll and Ruby, as well as mobile development platforms like React Native and Flutter.

&emsp;If you're interested in contacting me, drop me a line at&nbsp;{% my_email %} or hit me up on my [LinkedIn](/linkedin) page. You can also check out my [resume](/resume) and my [portfolio](/portfolio). My current work is mostly front and back-end web development, but I'm always excited to pick up new skills.

&emsp;And thanks for checking out my site!
