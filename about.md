<p style="margin-top: 20px;">&emsp; Hi! I'm Sean Hofer, an Email Developer / Growth Engineer at
  <a href="https://www.minted.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Minted</a>, an online marketplace of
  independent artists and designers in San Francisco, CA.
</p>
<p>&emsp;In my time at Minted so far I've lead implementation of product recommendations into our triggered
  and transactional emails, and I've helped the marketing team with a number of A/B test implementations and
  UI updates and fixes as a flexible engineering resource. In my previous position at <a
    href="https://www.feedingchildreneverywhere.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Feeding Children
    Everywhere</a>, I helped to build and launch Full Cart, a meal kit delivery application that has now grown
  to serve over 1000 households weekly.
</p>
<p>&emsp;I'm quick to adapt to new languages and libraries, and I have a knack for coming up with creative
  solutions to technical problems. I'm also proficient with web technologies like HTML5/CSS3, React,
  jQuery, Python and Node.js, as well as mobile development platforms like React Native and Flutter.
</p>
<p>&emsp;If you're interested in contacting me, drop me a line at
  <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">{{ site.email }}</a> or hit me up on
  my <a href="/linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> page. You can also check out my
  <a href="/resume" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">resume</a> and my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>.
  My current work is mostly front/back-end web development, but I'm always excited to pick up new skills.
</p>
<p>&emsp; And thanks for checking out my site!</p>
