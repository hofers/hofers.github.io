:wave: Hi! I'm Sean Hofer, an Email Developer / Growth Engineer at {% outbound_link https://www.minted.com | Minted %}, an online marketplace of independent artists and designers in San Francisco, CA.

&emsp;In my time at Minted so far I've led implementation of product recommendations into our triggered and transactional emails, and I've helped the marketing team with a number of A/B test implementations and UI updates and fixes as a flexible engineering resource. In my previous position at {% outbound_link https://www.feedingchildreneverywhere.com | Feeding Children Everywhere %}, I helped to build and launch Full Cart, a meal kit delivery application that has now grown to serve over 1000 households weekly.

&emsp;I'm quick to adapt to new languages and libraries, and I have a knack for coming up with creative solutions to technical problems. I'm also proficient with web technologies like HTML5/CSS3, React, jQuery, Python and Node.js, as well as mobile development platforms like React Native and Flutter.

&emsp;If you're interested in contacting me, drop me a line at&nbsp;{% my_email %} or hit me up on my {% outbound_link /linkedin | LinkedIn %} page. You can also check out my {% inbound_link /resume | resume %} and my {% inbound_link /portfolio | portfolio %}. My current work is mostly front and back-end web development, but I'm always excited to pick up new skills.

&emsp; And thanks for checking out my site!
