[jekyll-replace-last](https://github.com/hofers/jekyll-replace-last){% out %} is a simple Ruby gem I made in the process of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){% out %}-izing my site for the purpose of automatically preventing [runts](https://forum.affinity.serif.com/index.php?/topic/75751-widows-orphans-runts-%C2%A0hyphenation-better-terminology){% out %} in text. Like its name would suggest, it's a simple Jekyll filter that can be used to replace the last instance of a substring within a given string. It's also my first ever published Ruby gem!&nbsp;:tada:
