An August 2018 change in our policy regarding product tracking resulted in a need to individually
label each meal bag packaged at a hunger project with a sticker denoting the associated project. I was
tasked with creating a simple PDF generation interface the operations team could use to create and
print the sticker sheets themselves. I accomplished this using <a href="http://pdfkit.org/">PDFKit</a>,
JavaScript and very minimal HTML.
