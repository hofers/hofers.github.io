The original Fed 40 mobile app was programmed in React Native, which I maintained until July 2018 when I rewrote the app from scratch in Flutter. It was originally just a form, with no navigation and little exposition. I expanded the app to include more functionality, like donations and links to blog posts, and also handled the implementation of new designs in two complete visual overhauls of the service. (*Note: This app is deprecated, so there are no longer any live links&nbsp;to it.*)
