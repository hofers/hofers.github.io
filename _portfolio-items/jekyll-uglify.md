[jekyll-uglify](https://github.com/hofers/jekyll-uglify){% out %} is a Jekyll plugin I wrote to uglify my JS when I publish an update to my website. It's a Ruby gem that essentially wraps [Uglifier](https://github.com/lautis/uglifier){% out %}&mdash;a Ruby wrapper for UglifyJS by [lautis](https://github.com/lautis){% out %}&mdash;as a Jekyll subcommand that can be incorporated into a build/publication process.
