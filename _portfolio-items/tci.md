<a href="https://movies.seanhofer.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">I aM a DB</a> is a project I did as a technical test for the <a href="https://www.teachtci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Teacher's Curriculum Institute</a>. I aM a DB is an app that lets users browse for and post movie reviews. It's my first project built using Ruby on Rails, and my first real introduction to unit testing (in Minitest). The front-end is built using React and Bootstrap and I'm using <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Movie DB</a>'s API for pulling movie information. A repo of its code can be found <a href="https://github.com/hofers/tci-movie-db" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">on GitHub</a>.
