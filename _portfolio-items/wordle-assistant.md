The [Wordle Assistant](https://seanhofer.com/wordle-assistant) is a companion application for [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html){% out %} which returns the pool of remaining valid solutions based on the guesses a user has already made. It was inspired by NYT's [WordleBot](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/upshot/wordle-bot.html){% out %} companion app and my mild annoyance at the unpredictablity of whether a word is actually in the final list of solutions. It's built with plain JavaScript and relies on regular expressions to find valid words.
