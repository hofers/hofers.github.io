A group project I worked on at [HackRiddle 2016](http://hackriddle.com){% out %}. I developed the Chrome extension that comprised the end-user interface. It could be used to send a screenshot and link as well as additional information about an instance of online abuse to a specified administrator with access to the backend dashboard. **Won 1st place in the Anti-Bullying category**. (*Note: This site is deprecated, so there are no longer any live instances&nbsp;of it.*)
