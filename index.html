              <p class="title">I'm Sean.</p>
              <p class="subtitle">An aspiring web developer and fan of eSports.</p>
              <p>&emsp; I'm a student at Valencia College pursuing an A.A. in Information Technology, which I intend to complete
                by the Summer of 2017, at which point I will transfer to UCF to pursue my B.S. in the same field. I'm also
                starting in January as a Web Design intern at <a href="http://www.feedingchildreneverywhere.com">Feeding Chidren Everywhere</a>,
                a non-profit organization that provides food to hungry children and families across the globe with the help
                of volunteers at various Hunger Projects across the nation. Additionally, I'm working on a handful of personal
                projects to self-teach various skills and flesh out my portfolio a bit (available in the next tab!). When
                I'm not in class or working, I can usually be found doing small side projects or watching LCS (TSM!).</p>
              <p>&emsp; Back in 2014, I moved to Orlando from Clearwater, FL, after graduating from the Center for Advanced
                Technologies at Lakewood High School. There, I was a member of a team comprised of hardworking, tech-minded
                students in charge of the creation and day-to-day operations of the Center's internal and external websites.
                In particular, I worked on developing the front-end web interface used to interact with our Electronic HallPass
                System, which replaced our outdated, "standard" high school hallpasses with fancy new ID cards. The system
                used card readers and a custom-made C# application to interact with our SharePoint database to keep track
                of when and where students checked in and out.</p>
              <p>&emsp; As for right now, I'm keeping my nose to the grind, focusing on school and keeping an eye out for any
                web development- or IT-related positions I can take up that might help me learn more about the field or further
                my career. If you're interested in contacting me, drop me a line at <a href="mailto:seanhofer8@gmail.com">seanhofer8@gmail.com</a>                or hit me up on my <a href="https://linkedin.com/profile/view?id=304844725">LinkedIn</a> page. You can also

              <p style="padding-left: 1em">Made from scratch by yours truly, using HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, D3.js, and a bit of Bootstrap. The
                little line animation in the home tab was made by randomly generating SVG paths using JavaScript and animating
                them with CSS3. I toyed around with a few other ideas, namely drawing specific objects, or generating ASCII
                images in random orders, but I eventually decided I liked the look of this the most!

              <p class="subtitle">"tattle.tech" Online Harassment Report Tool Chrome Extension (Winner of the #HackHarrassment "Best Anti-Bullying
                Hack" at HackRiddle 2016)</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 1em">The Chrome extension portion of the tattle.tech tool made by some friends and I at HackRiddle 2016. It allows
                you to submit an abuse report to a local authority monitoring any tattle.tech reports. Includes a screenshot
                of the page and the URL of the reported abuse, along with a categorization and additional details about the
                reporter and the incident itself. This part was made entirely by me and can be found on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/hofers/tattle-tech-chrome-extension">here</a>.

              <p class="subtitle">"Peter O'Tool" Chrome extenstion (Early development)</p>
              <p style="padding-left: 1em">In the very early stages still, I plan to develop a simple extension for use with Google Chrome that would
                bring up a larger version of an image on hover, but will also display an image of Peter O'Toole at random
                on occasion, with the frequency of this occurence being adjustable. A novelty extension, to be sure, but
                it will mostly serve as a learning tool (and probably as a funny story at some point).
