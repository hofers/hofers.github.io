This is the repo for my personal professional site, available at https://seanhofer.com. It's hosted on GitHub Pages but it's built and deployed via a custom GitHub Action that allows me to include custom plugins disallowed by GitHub Pages. My DNS services are handled by Cloudflare and my domain is from Google Domains.

It's made with Jekyll and Sass, and it uses a few simple Jekyll plugins I made to wrap Ruby functionality for use in my site and build and publishing processesâ€”[jekyll-replace-last](https://github.com/hofers/jekyll-replace-last), [jekyll-uglify](https://github.com/hofers/jekyll-uglify) and [jekyll-make-sitemap](https://github.com/hofers/jekyll-make-sitemap). Check out each of their respective repositories to learn more.

I use Mozilla's [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) for PDF embedding.

My Jekyll source code can be found on the [`jekyll`](https://github.com/hofers/hofers.github.io/tree/jekyll) branch, and my compiled static site can be found on the [`master`](https://github.com/hofers/hofers.github.io/tree/master) branch.
