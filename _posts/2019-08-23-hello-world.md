## An introductory post to my class blog

For the first post to my class blog, I sat down to play a game I found on archive.org's internet arcade called [Hangman](https://archive.org/details/arcade_hangman). It's the classic pen-and-paper game we all probably know well, only in an arcade cabinet (or in this case, a browser). 

Video games and paper games have a couple different advantages (as mentioned in class). Notably in this case, scoring was handled in a way that was not immediately clear to me. Because video games self-enforce rules, unclear rulesets can lead to frustrating experiences.

For example, on a number of occasions I would pick a letter incorrectly and it would result in an automatic loss (from 0 strikes). However, it only did this sometimes, and I couldn't discern a pattern. After a bit of trial and error, I eventually realized what was happening: spinning randomizes the score you get, and selecting Go For It locks that score and removes your extra lives (this makes sense but was never explained).

Note to self: when making digital versions of paper games, make sure the rules are consistent!
