## *Hexadecimate* Final Rules 

***
<!-- e -->

**Number of players**: 2

**Duration**: 20 mins

1. Each player starts with 7 units.  
2. Arrange the board like so: ![Board Layout](/assets/images/game-board.jpg)
3. Play order is determined by card draw; whoever draws the higher card goes first. Reshuffle the deck after.
4. On their respective turns, each player moves their units a number of times equal to their total units. Moves can be distributed in any way, but players must use every move each turn.

    *e.g. On your first turn, you have 7 moves, one for each unit.*

5. A unit can attack an enemy unit when it occupies a space adjacent to it. This attack can be augmented by up to 2 other adjacent ally units, at a cost of 1 move per augmentation. 
6. Defense can be augmented in the same fashion.
7. During an attack, the attacker draws a card for each unit used, keeping the highest. The defender then does the same, and whoever has the highest card wins. Ties go to the defender.

*e.g. Each player has a unit in an <span style="color:#e0bd02;">augmentation space</span>. When <span style="color:red;">Red</span> attacks <span style="color:blue;">Blue</span>, they can each choose to use that unit to <span style="color:#e0bd02;">augment</span> their attack/defense. Attacking with additional units costs 1 move per additional unit used.*

8. After a successful attack, your unit moves into the space the defending unit once occupied, and that unit is destroyed.
9. After a successful defense, the attacking unit is destroyed. 
10. The deck should only be shuffled after it  has been exhausted. 
11. The first player to eliminate the enemy army is victorius!
